âœ… Problem Statement:
Create a Java program using three threads where:
    Thread A prints "A"
    Thread B prints "B"
    Thread C prints "C"

The goal is to print the sequence ABC repeatedly, say N times (for example, N = 5), so the final output would be:
ABCABCABCABCABC

Each thread must print only its own character, and the threads must coordinate so that the sequence always follows the A -> B -> C order.
