❓ Problem Statement:
You are given a number N and M threads.
Write a multithreaded Java program where each thread prints numbers from 1 to N in a round-robin fashion.

For example, if N = 10 and M = 3, the output should be like:

Thread-1: 1
Thread-2: 2
Thread-3: 3
Thread-1: 4
Thread-2: 5
Thread-3: 6
Thread-1: 7
Thread-2: 8
Thread-3: 9
