- Use wait(), notify(), notifyAll() only inside synchronized block.
- We learnt a way how multiple threads can share variables.
- Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException: current thread is not owner
    - This error occurs when you try to call wait() outside the synchronized block or when wait() is not called on object on which lock
    is acquired.
- It is recommended to use wait() inside a while loop, where while loop constantly check condition. Why?
